# Automated Deployment of Node.js Application to Railway Using GitHub Actions with Integrated Testing

This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a Node.js application to the Railway platform using GitHub Actions. It includes integrated testing to ensure the reliability and functionality of the deployed application. By leveraging GitHub Actions, you can streamline your development workflow, automatically deploy updates to your Railway environment, and run tests to validate the correctness of your code changes. This automated deployment and testing process helps maintain the quality and consistency of your application while reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of errors.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the directory containing the application:

    ```bash
    cd [project_directory]
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies using npm (Node.js package manager):

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**: If your application requires environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the variables accordingly.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Server**: To run the application locally, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    This will start the server, and the application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.

2. **Accessing the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

## Automated Unit Tests

This application includes automated unit tests to verify its functionality. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm test
 ```

# GitHub Actions Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline for this project is defined in the `.github/workflows` directory. It consists of steps for linting, testing, and deploying the application.

## Manually Triggering the Pipeline

To manually trigger the pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Push Changes to a Branch**: Push your changes to a branch in the repository.

2. **Create a Pull Request**: Create a pull request against the main branch.

3. **Automatic Pipeline Run**: GitHub Actions will automatically run the pipeline.

4. **View Pipeline Status and Logs**: View the status and logs of the pipeline in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.

## Deployment to Railway

To deploy the application to Railway, follow these steps:

1. **Generate Railway Token**:
   - Log in to your Railway account.
   - Navigate to your account settings or profile settings.
   - Find the section for API tokens or project tokens.
   - Generate a new token with sufficient permissions for deploying applications.

2. **Add Token to GitHub Repository Secrets**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the "Settings" tab.
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets".
   - Click on "New repository secret".
   - Name the secret something like `RAILWAY_TOKEN`.
   - Paste the token you generated from Railway into the "Value" field.
   - Click "Add secret" to save it.

3. **Modify GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Open the GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository (usually located at `.github/workflows` directory).
   - Find the step where the deployment to Railway occurs.
   - Update the workflow to use the secret you created. Typically, this involves referencing the secret using `${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}` syntax.

4. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   - After making the necessary modifications to the GitHub Actions workflow file, commit the changes and push them to your repository.

5. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Once the changes are pushed, GitHub Actions should automatically trigger a new pipeline run.
   - Check the pipeline logs to ensure that the deployment step successfully uses the Railway token from the repository secrets.
